# Work-Calendar-Scheduler

## Description

This calendar planner is designed to utilize the working hours of 9am-5pm and dynamically change color depending on whether it is in the past, present, or future of the current local time. Each hour block contains a text field that can be saved using the buttons on the right. It is designed for quick notes for throughout the work day. I learned how to utilize the inner workings of the the time functions in day.js and how to manipulate html elements based on real time events.
